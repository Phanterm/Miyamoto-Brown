//Enemy behavior:
/* Swoops up from below. Invulnerable and doesn't do damage during this time. 
Flies down from above in a group pattern, will usually have 3 enemies in a single cluster. 
Should be rather fast.   It basically does a Kamikaze attack, so this enemy does not fire.

DO NOT PLACE THIS ENEMY ON THE LEVEL. USE ENEMYB_SPAWNER INSTEAD
*/

/*STUFF TO FIX: 
* Controller properties: When the player crosses the line, spawn a random amount (1-6) below the player
